Introduction to Git:

    Git is an open-source and free version control system that helps manage source code changes efficiently.
    It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.
    Git tracks changes in files and allows multiple developers to work on the same project.
    It provides features like branching, merging and reverting changes.
    It is very efficient, secure and widely used in software development.

Note :

    Git is a local repository
        git init creates a .git folder that stores the entire project history on your computer, enabling offline version control.
    Git is a distributed system
        git clone gives every user a complete copy of the repository, allowing collaboration through git push and git pull with remote repositories.

Features of Git:

    Distributed System -
        Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
    Branching & Merging -
        Developers can create branches to test features and merge them later.
    Speed & Performance -
        Git processes changes quickly, even for large projects.
    Data Integrity -
        Git ensures every change is tracked and stored securely. It uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) for secure data storage.
    Efficient Collaboration -
        Git allows multiple developers to work together seamlessly.
    Lightweight & Flexible -
        Git uses minimal resources and supports various workflows.

Benefits of Git:

    Git improves the development process by making it more organized and secure.
    Below are some important benifits of Git :-
        Collaboration -
            Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
        History Tracking -
            Every change is recorded, making it easy to revert mistakes.
        Offline Work -
            Unlike centralized systems, Git works without an internet connection.
        Fast & Scalable -
            Git handles large repositories efficiently.
        Open Source & Free -
            Available for everyone, with no cost.
